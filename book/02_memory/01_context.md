1. Why an Implicit context vs Explicit like Zig uses?

   The implicit context I've written about in the overview and FAQ already, but most people really misunderstand it even when they read it. It's for intercepting third-party code because most people will not use custom allocators and only the defaults, but the context allows you to override it when others don't even use it.
